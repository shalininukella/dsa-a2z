## ðŸ§© Problem Statement

Given an array `arr[]` containing integers and an integer `k`, your task is to find the **length of the longest subarray** where the **sum of its elements is equal to `k`**.

If there is **no subarray** with sum equal to `k`, return `0`.

## âœ… Examples

### Example 1:
```

Input: arr\[] = \[10, 5, 2, 7, 1, -10], k = 15
Output: 6

Explanation:
Subarrays with sum = 15 are:

* \[5, 2, 7, 1]
* \[10, 5]
* \[10, 5, 2, 7, 1, -10]

The longest has length = 6

```

### Example 2:
```

Input: arr\[] = \[-5, 8, -14, 2, 4, 12], k = -5
Output: 5

Explanation:
Only subarray with sum = -5 is:
\[-5, 8, -14, 2, 4]

```

---

### Example 3:
```

Input: arr\[] = \[10, -10, 20, 30], k = 5
Output: 0

Explanation:
No subarray with sum = 5 is present.

```

## ðŸ“Š Constraints

- `1 â‰¤ arr.size() â‰¤ 10^5`
- `-10^4 â‰¤ arr[i] â‰¤ 10^4`
- `-10^9 â‰¤ k â‰¤ 10^9`

## ðŸš€ Expected Time Complexity

- **Time:** `O(N)`
- **Space:** `O(N)`

## ðŸ’¡ Approach (Recommended)

Use the **Prefix Sum + Hash Map** method to handle:
- Positive and negative numbers
- Efficient lookup of previous prefix sums

Refer to the solution section for implementation.
